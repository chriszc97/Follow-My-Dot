### ***Technologies Used***
* CSS Grid
* Event listeners
    * Load event
    * KeyDown event
    * Click event
### ***Getting Started***
##### We would have to make the layout first, we need to make a layout of the title screen, score board where the player is able to see there current score, and the grid itself where our snake is going to be. Also in our HTML page we should add a reset button to reset the game. We also would need to make a dot and when it gets touched, then the user gets a point. The dot also moves a certain amount of pixes after being touched. We also have to give the user acsess to input from the arrow keys so that they move the snake. We call the event listener for key down events to get response from user. Logic of the game will consist of: the user starts with the snake in the middle. Then based on the user input the snake could turn right,left,up,down. The snake must continuously keep moving after the first direction has been made and not stop untill it has touched the dot. Or move a different direction. If the the user touches the border of the game grid then they get an alert saying that they are going out of bounds, however the user is able to play afterwards. Once game is over we display a screen to indicate game over and that they have reached ten points. The user gets one point for ever time they touch the dot. 
##### A Trello board was used to keep track of the development progress and can be viewed [here.](https://trello.com/b/E17uenko/requirements)

### ***Description***
Follow my dot game is a simple game close to the snake game. However the snake does not increase in size. The objective is to reach ten points by moving the snake with the X on it. The user has control with the arrow keys. Once the user gains ten point from touching the dot, the user wins and is able to hit the reset button to play again.
