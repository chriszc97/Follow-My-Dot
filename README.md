### ***Description***
My snake project is a simulation of the original snake game, where a player continues to play until the head touches the body. This game is being made because personally I use to love playing snake as kid and want to re make it.

### ***Getting Started***
##### We would have to make the layout first, we need to make a layout of the title screen, score board where the player sees its current score and previous high score, and the grid itself where our snake is going to be. We also would need to make a snake object with constructoers of head and body, and a method where when the head tocuhes the dot its body is incremented by one. We also need the dot to spawn ramdomly on our grid. We also have to give the user acsess to input from the key board so that they move the snake. Logic of the game will consist of: the user starts with snake of length one and also moves in a straight line. Based on the used input the snake could turn right,left,up,down. The snake must continuously keep moving after the first direction has been made and not stop untill the head has touches the body or the border of the grib. Once game over display a screen to indicate game over. 
##### A Trello board was used to keep track of the development progress and can be viewed [here.](https://trello.com/b/E17uenko/requirements)
